# Kaggle Space Titanic challenge
This notebook is a brief example of cleaning the data and creating a classification model to solve the Kaggle Space Titanic challenge.  
I do not perform a lot of feature engineering nor attempt other algorithms outside a random forest. However, the model performed relatively well.
At the time I did the challenge my results were at around 79% accuracy on first submission, which was about 3% less than the 2nd place model.  
Not bad for a quick and dirty approach!
